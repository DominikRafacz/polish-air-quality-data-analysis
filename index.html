Studies then went on to praise the by-product of the pandemic: Reduced emissions. But as people stayed home and worked online and the push for smart factories on the rise, to what extent are we looking at emissions dropping, or simply emissions transitioning from one type to another.</p><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">The data from the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection allows us to keen insights into emissions from Poland, one of Europe’s biggest polluters, on a full scale covering each region and over 1000 measurement stations, and the data collected hourly for the past 20+ years of 15 types of pollution such as SO2, CO.</p><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">Poland COVID-19 mobility trends dataset somehow shows how the pandemic affects the day-to-day number of human outdoor activities and shows the increase or decrease of people staying at home, both of them might turn into the increase/decrease the potential pollution.</p><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">The datasets provided by Poland's Local Data Bank allow us to get a general idea of the socio-economic climate inside Poland. We can then see the disparities between regions in terms of industrial vs rural using factors such as forest locations and buildings through the census. And we can also see wealthier vs poorer using the building census data, average wages, and population density.</p></div><div class="container mx-auto flex flex-col items-start md:flex-row my-12 md:my-24"><div class="ml-0 md:ml-12 lg:w-2/3 sticky"><div class="container mx-auto w-full h-full"><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/AverageWages.0d0d3bc1.svg"><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/ForestHectares.db39cf11.svg"><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/PopDensity.97f8b655.svg"></div></div><div class="flex flex-col w-full sticky md:top-36 lg:w-1/3 mt-2 md:mt-12 px-8"><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">Here we can see Poland. Poland is distributed into 16 regions known as voivodeships. And they are as follows: Wielkopolskie, Kujawsko-Pomorskie, Małopolskie, Łódzkie, Dolnośląskie, Lubelskie, Lubuskie, Mazowieckie, Opolskie, Podlaskie, Pomorskie, Śląskie, Podkarpackie, Świętokrzyskie, Warmińsko-Mazurskie, and Zachodniopomorskie.</p><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">For our first diagram, here we can see the average wages earned per month in Złoty (pln). Here it is abundantly clear that the capital region, Mazowieckie, far exceeds that of the vast majority of all the other regions, paying up to 50% more than some of the lowest earning regions.</p><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">In our second diagram, we can see the overall forest area represented in hectares across Poland, with this notice how the northern regions such as Zachodniopomorskie and Warmińsko-mazurskie are particularly forest dense whereas regions such as Opolskie and Śląskie down in the south have far fewer hectares of forest.</p><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">Linking with our next diagram, we can see the population density where Śląskie, that is shown to lack the forests that other northern regions are abundant in, is far denser than any other region.</p></div></div><div class="container mx-auto my-12 md:my-24 flex flex-col"><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">Finally lets have a look at the distribution of land usage across Poland, if you have ever looked at a satellite photo of Poland it might be obvious to you, but here in the diagram below it can be seen that over 80% for all regions in Poland, the land is either used for agriculture, or is forests. But what is interesting to see is how, <b class="industrial">Śląskie</b>, has the biggest percentage of residential and industrial areas out of all the regions, and with the lack of forests and the immense population density, we can definitely expect this region to be a primary producer of air pollution within Poland. Now conversely if we look at a <b class="rural">Warmińsko-mazurskie</b>, a region that has a greater number of forests and a low percentage of residential area we can expect this area to produce much lower amounts of pollution. And as our middle case, a blend between forests and residential, the capital region, <b class="capital">Mazowieckie</b>, for quality of life, and due to a wealther populus, this region can be expected to not emit large amounts of pollution, but still noticeable due to how wealthier citizens tend emit more due to their habits.</p><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/DistributionLandUse.44a1b214.svg"></div><div class="container mx-auto my-12 md:my-24 flex flex-col"><p>Now lets see how the Polish people moved, more specifically those with an iPhone or iWatch. Throughout the pandemic apple recorded the movement or thereby lack of, of people and represented this as increases or decreases compared to their baseline. Using this data, and corresponding dates of restrictions being implemented or being lifted, these two are coordinate as seen in the diagram below where the percentage changes reflect what would be expected of imposing restrictions. That is until we hit April 2021, where it is seen that more people are mobile despite being in the third wave restrictions and eventually hitting Poland’s all time Covid case high. Well why is this important? Before that lets talk about our air pollution data.</p><br><img class="object-contain" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/Timeline.5b48b507.svg"></div><div class="container mx-auto flex flex-col items-start md:flex-row my-12 md:my-24"><div class="ml-0 md:ml-12 lg:w-2/3 sticky"><div class="container mx-auto w-full h-full"><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/HighlightedMapOfMeasurementStations.12fb3a3b.svg"></div></div><div class="flex flex-col w-full sticky md:top-36 lg:w-1/3 mt-2 md:mt-12 px-8"><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">For our pollution data we rely on on hundreds of measurement stations scattered across all regions in Poland and the number of stations has changed over time. The number of active stations in Poland gradually increased from almost 0 in 1965 to more than 500 in 2005. From 2005 onwards, numbers started to drop and there was a significantly decrease in 2010, reducing from about 450 to 300. But, in recent ten years (2010-2020), the number of active stations is stable at around 260 total. In this diagram here you can see the distribution of measurement stations and how not all regions have as many as others, for example <b class="rural">Warmińsko-mazurskie</b> has relatively few compared to <b class="capital">Mazowieckie</b>, and the industrial region <b class="industrial">Śląskie</b>, and this is something that should be kept in mind as we progress further and explore the data.</p></div></div><h1 class="md:text-3xl text-base text-gray-100 font-bold font-mono md:w-2xl text-center mx-auto underline decoration-indigo-500">Pollution Data</h1><div class="container mx-auto flex flex-col items-start md:flex-row my-12 md:my-24"><div class="ml-0 md:ml-12 lg:w-2/3 sticky"><div class="container mx-auto w-full h-full"><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/pollution_timeline_PM2.5.0c99734a.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/pollution_timeline_PM10.58a5ca3a.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/pollution_timeline_NOx.ab8eebcb.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/pollution_timeline_CO.154a88e8.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/pollution_barplot.143ea36c.svg"></div></div><div class="flex flex-col w-full sticky md:top-12 lg:w-1/3 mt-2 md:mt-12 px-8"><img class="w-80 h-80 mx-auto" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/Legend.0a3d7bfc.svg"><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">Now lets look at some pollution Data. For our comparison we’re comparing Particulate Matter of sizes 2.5 and 10 micrometers (PM2.5, PM10), Nitrous Oxide (NOx) and Carbon Monoxide (CO). First we will have a look at the time frame from 2015 to 2020 so that we can understand the general trend our chosen regions follow. As we can see with PM2.5 and PM10 these exhibit a trend that we would expect. With the <b class="rural">rural area</b> emitting lower, and our <b class="industrial">industrial area</b> emitting greater, and our <b class="capital">capital region</b> sitting right in-between. What is interesting to observe is that when we map out NOx, our <b class="capital">capital region</b> and <b class="industrial">industrial region</b> are quite close together often even overlapping in the earlier years, and our <b class="rural">rural region</b> emits far less showing us a noticeable difference in the NOx plot. However once we look at CO, all regions are now closely bundled together, although <b class="industrial">Śląskie’s</b> peaks still exceed both other regions, during winter, during summer, the region even emits below the rural region as seen in mid year 2016. This is most likely a byproduct of coal burners being widespread throughout Poland as a method for heating residential homes, especially seen during 2017 where a harsh winter had come over Poland.</p></div></div><h1 class="md:text-3xl text-base text-gray-100 font-bold font-mono md:w-2xl text-center mx-auto underline decoration-indigo-500">Predictions</h1><h2 class="text-gray-200 font-bold font-mono md:w-prose text-center mx-auto">How did the covid years stand-up to previous years</h2><div class="container mx-auto flex flex-col items-start md:flex-row my-12 md:my-24"><div class="ml-0 md:ml-12 lg:w-2/3 sticky"><div class="container mx-auto w-full h-full"><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/prediction_SO2.8992dadf.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/prediction_NOx.499a54f8.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/prediction_CO.e52342cc.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/prediction_PM10.424464b0.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/prediction_PM2.5.da6a8d50.svg"></div></div><div class="flex flex-col w-full sticky md:top-36 lg:w-1/3 mt-2 md:mt-12 px-8"><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">Using a machine learning model, and taking the data from 2015 to 2019, we are able to create a prediction of what 2020 to the end of 2021 should have looked like and what to the model is an expected range for for values to fall in to. Then with the actual data of 2020 and 2021, we are able to see how well our model did to predict given that an ongoing global pandemic had shut down various industries, and grounded people to their homes. However if you look at these prediction vs actual graphs we can see that the vast majority of real data has fallen well within our models confidence interval, and followed the general trend of our predictions almost like a pandemic had no noticeable effect upon the emissions of Sulpher Dioxide (SO2), NOx, CO, PM2.5, and PM10. Albeit for a single month in 2021, October, The pollution of SO2, was actually much greater than what we would have predicted it to be.</p></div></div><h1 class="md:text-3xl text-base text-gray-100 font-bold font-mono md:w-2xl text-center mx-auto underline decoration-indigo-500">Correlating Data</h1><h2 class="text-gray-200 font-bold font-mono md:w-prose text-center mx-auto">What do we see from a mobility stand point</h2><div class="container mx-auto flex flex-col items-start md:flex-row my-12 md:my-24"><div class="ml-0 md:ml-12 lg:w-2/3 sticky"><div class="container mx-auto w-full h-full"><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/comparison_SO2.fe78884d.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/comparison_NOx.127a52e1.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/comparison_CO.7633d188.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/comparison_PM10.f11c5405.svg"><br><img class="w-full" src="/polish-air-quality-data-analysis/assets/comparison_PM2.5.522c4498.svg"></div></div><div class="flex flex-col w-full sticky md:top-36 lg:w-1/3 mt-2 md:mt-12 px-8"><p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-50 mb-4">Now that we have our predictions, let us find out if the mobility of people in Poland had any effect on the pollution levels. First using our predictions for 2020 and 2021 as the base line, and taking the difference between that and the actual measured data of 2020 and 2021, we produce a set of data that shows us the deviation from what was expected. Finally using our mobility data over the same period of time we are able to check for any correlations and matching patterns that might have occurred to the increase or decrease of people’s mobility. However as you might have noticed, throughout these plots that there are no clear indications of a correlation, and with every plot we have produced a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient to try and mathematically find a correlation. Yet our highest correlation lies between SO2 pollution and Walking, with a coefficient of 0.56, an unlikely combination as it has not been shown that walking gives off an amount of SO2 pollution.</p></div></div><h1 class="md:text-3xl text-base text-gray-100 font-bold mb-6 font-mono md:w-2xl text-center mx-auto underline decoration-indigo-500">Conclusion</h1><div class="container w-prose mx-auto mb-12"><p>So what does this all mean? Well simply that during the Covid pandemic, Poland’s pollution levels did not drop despite numerous restrictions and reduced mobility from its people, regardless of which region they came from, and if those regions were industrial, rural, or somewhere in between. The pandemic failed to slow down Poland, one of Europe’s biggest polluters.</p></div><footer><p class="text-sm text-center">Nice to meet you down here! Thanks for giving us a read!
