## Attention!

Since we are using a lot of code and don't want to have the explainer notebook too long, redundant parts are extracted into separate files (`validate.py`, `utils.py`, `read.py`, `model.py`, `visualize.py`). If you want to rerun the code contained here, you need to have them in the same file as the notebook. All the data that is small enough to be hosted on GitHub is contained in `data` folder -- this folder also needs to be located in the same diretory as the notebook. Rest of our data is too big to be hosted here, so we have created a script to download it -- `download.py`. If you want to reproduce the analysis, you need to run the script first. Additionally, we are using an external plot style, `pitayasmoothie-dark.mplstyle` -- again, it needs to be in the same place as the notebook.
